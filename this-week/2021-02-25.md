# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-02-25

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 4 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [643](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/643): (11/64) update: Add Reduced Reboots enhancement (sdodson)

  > This enhancement is intended to reduce host reboots when upgrading across two or
  > more OpenShift minor versions by enabling an N-2 version skew policy between all
  > host components and cluster scoped resources.

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (10/121) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

- [628](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/628): (5/104) general: automated resource request scaling (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes an approach to allow us to scale the
  > resource requests for the control plane services to reduce consumption
  > for constrained environments. This will be especially useful for
  > single-node production deployments, where the user wants to reserve
  > most of the CPU resources for their own workloads and needs to
  > configure OpenShift to run on a fixed number of CPUs within the host.
  >
  > One example of this use case is seen in telecommunication service
  > providers implementation of a Radio Access Network (RAN). This use case
  > is discussed in more detail below.

- [636](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/636): (3/51) kube-apiserver: API Removal Notifications (sanchezl)

  > Notify customers that an API that will be removed in the next release is in use.

### Prioritized Closed Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There was 1 Prioritized Closed pull request:

- [641](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/641): (6/33) general: EP: Support for Cluster High-availability mode API (varshaprasad96)

## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [577](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/577): (32/177) ingress: describe one-stop-shopping for exposing customized routes (deads2k)

  > Add `CustomizeableRoute{Spec,Status}` to `IngressSpec` in a way that allows multiple operators to provide information about
  > Routes (or Ingresses, or maybe even something else), that a cluster-admin wants to provide custom names and/or custom
  > serving certificates for.

- [625](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/625): (21/30) cluster-logging: Simplify JSON forwarding proposal (alanconway)

  > This enhancement will allow structured JSON log entries to be forwarded as JSON objects in JSON output records.
  >
  > The current logging [data model][data_model] stores the log entry as a JSON *string*, not a JSON *object*.
  > Consumers can't access the log entry fields without a second JSON parse of this string.
  >
  > The current implementation also 'flattens' labels to work around Elasticsearch limitations.
  >
  > To illustrate, given a log entry `{"name":"fred","home":"bedrock"}` from a container with the label `app.kubernetes.io/name="flintstones"`.
  > The current output record looks like:
  >
  > ```json
  > {
  >   "message":"{\"name\":\"fred\",\"home\":\"bedrock\"}",
  >   "kubernetes":{"flat_labels":["app_kubernetes_io/name=flintstones", ...]},
  >   ... other metadata
  > }
  > ```
  >
  > This proposal enables an alternate form of output record including a `structured` object field for JSON log entries and user-defined `schema` name to identify the format of the entry.
  >
  > ```json
  > {
  >   "structured":{
  >     "name":"fred",
  >     "home":"bedrock",
  >   }",
  >   "schema": "flintstones-schema",
  >   "kubernetes":{"labels":{"app.kubernetes.io/name": "flintstones", ...}},
  >   ...
  > }
  > ```
  >
  > This proposal describes
  >
  > * extensions to the logging [data model][data_model] - `structured` and `schema` fields.
  > * extensions to the `ClusterLogForwarder` API to configure JSON parsing and forwarding.
  > * indexing structured records in current and future Elasticsearch stores.
  > * replacing the [defunct MERGE_JSON_LOG][defunct_merge] feature.
  >
  > **Note**: This proposal focuses on JSON, but the data model and API changes can apply to other structured formats that may be supported in future.

#### Minor Other Merged Updates

- [658](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/658): (5/5) network: ovn-kubernetes-ipsec: Update EP with small feature enhancements for OCP 4.8 (markdgray)

### Other New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 9 Other New pull requests:

- [660](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/660): (11/11) cluster-logging: Flow control API enhancements, first draft. (alanconway)

  > If the log collector cannot keep up with the rate that logs are written, some logging data will be lost.
  > Presently the logging admin has little control over when or how logs get lost.
  >
  > This proposal defines an API to let cluster administrators to limit logging rates, or ignore some logs entirely.
  > Logs will still be lost if the collector cannot keep up, but administrators have more control over *what* is lost.
  >
  > Rate limits mean that:
  >
  > * The cost and volume of logging can be predicted more accurately in advance.
  > * Noisy containers cannot produce unbounded log traffic and unfairly drown out other containers.
  > * High-value logs can be preferred over low-value logs by assigning higher rate limits.
  > * Log streams that are not needed can be ignored, which reduces the load on the logging infrastructure.
  >
  > The API allows selected rates and policies to be applied by namespaces or pod labels.
  > New types of selector that are added in future should also be applicable.

- [661](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/661): (41/41) operator-framework-api: New OpenshiftCatalogueValidator in operator-framework/api (camilamacedo86)
- [663](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/663): (9/9) dns: Add configurable-dns-pod-placement enhancement (Miciah)

  > The DNS operator in OpenShift 4.7 and prior versions manages a DaemonSet that
  > serves two functions: running CoreDNS and managing node hosts' `/etc/hosts`
  > files.  This enhancement, in OpenShift 4.8, replaces this single DaemonSet with
  > two: one DaemonSet for CoreDNS and one DaemonSet for managing `/etc/hosts`.
  > Additionally, this enhancement adds an API to enable cluster administrators to
  > configure the placement of the CoreDNS Pods.

- [664](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/664): (10/10) ingress: Add proxy-protocol enhancement (Miciah)

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API to allow cluster
  > administrators to configure IngressControllers that use the "HostNetwork"
  > and "NodePortService" endpoint publishing strategies to use [PROXY
  > protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.2/doc/proxy-protocol.txt).

- [665](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/665): (8/8) ingress: Add power-of-two-random-choices enhancement (Miciah)

  > This enhancement provisionally changes the default balancing algorithm to
  > HAProxy's [Power of Two Random
  > Choices](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/power-of-two-load-balancing/) algorithm.
  > In OpenShift 4.7, the default algorithm is always "Least Connections".  In
  > OpenShift 4.8, a "PowerOfTwoRandomChoicesBalancing" feature gate is added.  When
  > this feature gate is enabled, ingress controllers use the Power of Two Random
  > Choices algorithm by default. The feature gate is off by default in OpenShift
  > 4.8 and on by default in OpenShift 4.9.

- [666](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/666): (2/2) kube-apiserver: adding new userequest audit policy  (EmilyM1)

  > This enhancement describes a high-level API in the `config.openshift.io/v1` API group to configure the audit policy for the
  > API servers in the system. The audit configuration will be part of the [`APIServers`](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/master/config/v1/0000_10_config-operator_01_apiserver.crd.yaml) resource.
  > It applies to all API servers at once.
  >
  > The API is meant to enable customers with stronger audit requirements than the average customer to increase the depth
  > (from _metadata_-only level, over _request payloads_ to _request and response payload_ level) of audit
  > logs, accepting the increased resource consumption of the API servers.
  >
  > This API is intentionally **not about filtering events**. Filtering is to be done via an external mechanism (post-filtering).
  > It was proven through performance tests (compare alternatives section) that this trade-off is acceptable with small two-digit percent overhead.
  >
  > The API is not meant to replace the [upstream dynamic audit](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/f1a799d5f4658ed29797c1fb9ceb7a4d0f538e93/keps/sig-auth/0014-dynamic-audit-configuration.md) API
  > now and in the future. I.e. the API of this enhancement is only about the master node audit files on disk, not about webhooks or
  > any other alternative audit log sink.

- [667](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/667): (4/4) cluster-logging: Rename API field `structured` as `parse` to avoid confusion. (alanconway)

- [668](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/668): (2/2) console: Add Customize Project Access Roles proposal (jerolimov)

  > The OpenShift Dev Console provides a simplified way to share access the selected project. Users can be assigned to specific roles under the Project menu item on the Project access tab. Currently only the roles "Admin", "Edit" and "View" are selectable.
  >
  > Cluster admins want give project admins only access to a customized list of predefined roles to force compliance rules or provide more options.

- [669](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/669): (1/1) console: Add Customize Add Page proposal (jerolimov)

  > The OpenShift Developer Console provides a long list options to import applications, components and services. This list could be extended also via extensions like the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, the OpenShift Serverless Operator, and other. Some customers want simplify the list by hiding some options (or add their own options later).
