# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-03-19

Over the past couple of weeks we have been working to expand the
documentation of our conventions, found in
https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md
and in the course of those coversations a few people have mentioned
that they weren't aware that document existed. It does! And it
includes some good information about the way we try to build
components consistently to provide the best experience for our
users. Take a look, and help document our collective knowledge by
proposing changes to add details that may be missing.

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [628](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/628): (13/141) general: automated resource request scaling (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes an approach to allow us to scale the
  > resource requests for the control plane services to reduce consumption
  > for constrained environments. This will be especially useful for
  > single-node production deployments, where the user wants to reserve
  > most of the CPU resources for their own workloads and needs to
  > configure OpenShift to run on a fixed number of CPUs within the host.
  >
  > One example of this use case is seen in telecommunication service
  > providers implementation of a Radio Access Network (RAN). This use case
  > is discussed in more detail below.

- [636](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/636): (4/57) kube-apiserver: API Removal Notifications (sanchezl)

  > Notify customers that an API that will be removed in the next release is in use.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Other Merged pull requests:

- [656](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/656): (4/64) console: CONSOLE-2355: Update Quick Start proposal with i18n (rebeccaalpert)

  > OpenShift's Serverless team has proposed an idea to create a "Quick Starts"
  > mechanism which introduces users to various ways of interacting with serverless
  > in the Console. Quick Starts should be a mechanism we can use to vastly improve
  > our customer's initial user experience on a empty cluster or with all various
  > workflows:
  >
  > The goal of this proposal is to define a lightweight mechanism for OpenShift's
  > Console component, to guide users thought various workflows, and help them
  > understand the steps neccesary to get the desired outcome.

- [696](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/696): (3/3) ingress: Ingress: Add details to tunable router buffer sizes EP (sgreene570)

  > This enhancement extends the IngressController API to allow the user to configure
  > the size of the in-memory header buffers for an IngressController. By default, these values are
  > set at fixed values to limit memory use for typical IngressController usage.

#### Other Merged Updates

- [698](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/698): (2/2) oc: update bump-oc doc (sallyom)


### Other New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 7 Other New pull requests:

- [693](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/693): (26/26) general: CONVENTIONS: Add section on limits (smarterclayton)

  > Some scenarios have been described where a limit is appropriate.
  > Add additional guidance.

- [694](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/694): (1/1) network: Amend egress router CNI controller (danielmellado)

  > Egress traffic is traffic going from OpenShift pods to external systems,
  > outside of OpenShift. There are a few  options for enabling egress traffic,
  > such as allow access to external systems from OpenShift physical node IPs, use
  > EgressFirewall, EgressIPs or in our case, EgressRouter.
  >
  > In enterprise environments, egress routers are often preferred. They
  > allow granular access from a specific pod, group of pods, or project to an
  > external system or service. Access via node IP means all pods running on a
  > given node can access external systems.
  >
  > An egress router is a pod that has two interfaces, (`eth0`) and (e.g. `macvlan0`).
  > `eth0` is on the cluster network in OpenShift (internal) and macvlan0 has an IP and
  > gateway from the external physical network.
  >
  > Pods can access the egress router service thus enabling them to access
  > external services. The egress router acts as a bridge between pods and an
  > external system.
  >
  > Traffic going out the egress router goes via node, but it will have the MAC
  > address of the macvlan0 interface inside the egress router.
  >
  > In openshift-sdn, the egress router [was implemented](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/admin_guide/managing_networking.html)
  > by adding an annotation to allow a pod to request a macvlan interface. In
  > order to avoid repeating this behavior in ovn-kubernetes, we'd be requesting
  > such interface using multus to ensure feature-parity with openshift-sdn.

- [695](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/695): (25/25) cluster-version-operator: move CVO upgrades doc to enhancements (deads2k)

  > Moves https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/docs/dev/upgrades.md into enhancements. This doc covers integration with other components, what those components need to do to participate, what impact they have on each other, and how a cluster upgrades.

- [697](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/697): (12/12) ingress: Add transition-ingress-from-beta-to-stable enhancement (Miciah)

  > This enhancement updates the
  > [ingress-to-route](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-controller-manager/blob/master/pkg/route/ingress/ingress.go)
  > controller to use the stable `networking.k8s.io/v1` version of the Ingress API.
  > Although the API server already supports the v1 API version without this
  > enhancement, the ingress-to-route controller requires changes to transition from
  > using the v1beta1 client to using the v1 client and to support new v1 features.
  > These new features include the `spec.pathType` and `spec.ingressClassType`
  > fields as well as the associated IngressClass API.  This enhancement does *not*
  > extend the Route API to accommodate new features in the Ingress API; these are
  > only supported to the extent that they are compatible with the Route API.

- [699](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/699): (5/5) cluster-logging: Updated for schema->index change (alanconway)

  > This enhancement will allow structured JSON log entries to be forwarded as JSON objects in JSON output records.
  >
  > This proposal describes
  >
  > * extensions to the logging [data model][data_model] - `structured` field.
  > * extensions to the `ClusterLogForwarder` API to configure JSON parsing and forwarding.
  > * extensions to the `ClusterLogForwarder` API to select an index.
  > * indexing structured records in current and future Elasticsearch stores.
  > * replacing the [defunct MERGE_JSON_LOG][defunct_merge] feature.

- [700](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/700): (2/2) storage: Add initial OEP for lso cleanup (gnufied)

  > This enhancement proposes a mechanism that will allow PVs provisioned by local-storage-operator(LSO) to be deleted and corresponding symlinks to be removed from the node when `LocalVolume` or `LocalVolumeSet` objects are deleted.

- [701](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/701): (2/2) monitoring: metrics scraping with local authentication and authorization (deads2k)

  > Monitoring needs to be reliable and is the very useful when trying to debug clusters in an already degraded state.
  > We want to ensure that metrics scraping can always work if the scraper can reach the target, even if the kube-apiserver
  > is unavailable or unreachable.
  > To do this, we will combine a local authorizer (already merged in many binaries and the rbac-proxy) and client-cert based
  > authentication to have a fully local authentication and authorization path for scraper targets.
