# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-03-05

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 3 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [628](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/628): (18/122) general: automated resource request scaling (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes an approach to allow us to scale the
  > resource requests for the control plane services to reduce consumption
  > for constrained environments. This will be especially useful for
  > single-node production deployments, where the user wants to reserve
  > most of the CPU resources for their own workloads and needs to
  > configure OpenShift to run on a fixed number of CPUs within the host.
  >
  > One example of this use case is seen in telecommunication service
  > providers implementation of a Radio Access Network (RAN). This use case
  > is discussed in more detail below.

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (9/130) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.

- [636](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/636): (2/53) kube-apiserver: API Removal Notifications (sanchezl)

  > Notify customers that an API that will be removed in the next release is in use.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 5 Other Merged pull requests:

- [581](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/581): (9/122) network: Add network flows export support proposal (rcarrillocruz)

  > Collecting all traffic from a cluster at a packet level would be an enormous amount of data.
  > An alternative approach for analysis of network traffic is to capture only metadata about the traffic in a cluster.
  > This metadata would include information like the protocols, source and destination addresses, port numbers, and the amount of traffic.
  > Collecting this metadata becomes a more manageable approach to getting visibility into network activity across the cluster.
  >
  > There are existing protocols for how this metadata is transmitted between systems, including NetFlow, IPFIX, and sFlow.
  > Open vSwitch (OVS) supports these protocols and OVS is a fundamental building block of the OVN-Kubernetes network type.
  >
  > This proposal discusses how we start providing this functionality by allowing cluster administrators to enable the export of network flow metadata using one of these protocols.


- [651](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/651): (7/9) cluster-logging: Implement forwarder-label-selector in 2 phases. (alanconway)

  > Add an input selector to the ClusterLogForwarder (CLF) to collect application
  > logs only from pods identified by labels.
  >
  > Kubernetes has two ways to identify pods: namespaces and labels.  The CLF
  > already has an input selector for namespaces, this enhancement will add a selector
  > for labels.

- [667](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/667): (5/6) cluster-logging: Rename API field `structured` as `parse` to avoid confusion. (alanconway)

  > This enhancement will allow structured JSON log entries to be forwarded as JSON objects in JSON output records.

#### Other Updates

- [649](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/649): (2/19) general: conventions: update the resources and limits section (dhellmann)

  > Expand the "Resources and Limits" section of the conventions document
  > with more detail about why we have the conventions we do, where the
  > formula for CPU resource requests came from, and links to the history
  > of work on resource requests.

- [672](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/672): (3/3) network: Fix schema and capitalization of netFlow/sFlow/ipfix (rcarrillocruz)

### Other New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 6 Other New pull requests:

- [671](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/671): (41/41) monitoring: enhancements/monitoring: Describe single replica topology mode (lilic)

  > The monitoring stack needs to react based on the `infrastructureTopology` field newly added to `infrastructures.config.openshift.io` CRD. Plan is to detect whenever
  > cluster is in single replica topology mode and reduce the monitoring stack footprint by adjusting platform monitoring
  > instances to be non Highly Available.

- [673](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/673): (5/5) machine-api: short-circuiting-backoff (mshitrit)

  > By using `MachineHealthChecks` a cluster admin can configure automatic remediation of unhealthy machines and nodes.
  > The machine healthcheck controller's remediation strategy is deleting the machine, and letting the cloud provider
  > create a new one. This isn't the best remediation strategy in all environments.
  >
  > Any Machine that enters the `Failed` state is remediated immediately, without waiting, by the MHC
  > When this occurs, if the error which caused the failure is persistent (spot price too low, configuration error), replacement Machines will also be `Failed`
  > As replacement machines start and fail, MHC causes a hot loop of Machine being deleted and recreated
  > Hot loop makes it difficult for users to find out why their Machines are failing.
  >
  > With this enhancement we propose a better mechanism.
  > In case a machine enters the `Failed` state and does not have a NodeRef or a ProviderID it'll be remediated after a certain time period has passed - thus allowing a manual intervention in order to break to hot loop.

- [674](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/674): (78/78) authentication: Service CA Certificate Generation for StatefulSet Pods, first version (mtrmac)

  > The Service CA can be used to automatically generate certificates for StatefulSets,
  > to allow TLS-protected communication between StatefulSet pods.
  >
  > The user adds a `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: $secretName` annotation,
  > and a `$secretName` secret is generated, which can be mounted in the StatefulSetâ€™s pods.
  >
  > Creating/scaling up a StatefulSet triggers
  > both creating the StatefulSet pods and a secret creation/update,
  > which race against each other.
  > So, the pods **must** fail, or wait, if a certificate for their identity is not found.

- [675](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/675): (2/2) operator-sdk: enhancements: Fix various links in the downstream operator-sdk proposal (timflannagan)

  > The Operator SDK currently ships the Ansible and Helm Operator base images
  > downstream. The purpose of this enhancement is to add a supported Operator SDK
  > base image as well as an operator-sdk binary. In addition, to add more
  > automation to syncing upstream with downstream.

- [676](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/676): (1/1) kube-apiserver: api compatibility (sanchezl)

  > The `Summary` section is incredibly important for producing high quality user-focused documentation such as release
  > notes or a development roadmap. It should be possible to collect this information before implementation begins in order
  > to avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release notes and implementing the feature
  > itself.
  >
  > A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

- [677](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/677): (5/5) kata-containers: kata containers enhancement proposal (fidencio)

  > [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) is an open source project developing a container runtime using virtual machines and providing the same look and feel as vanilla containers.
  > By leveraging hardware virtualization technologies, Kata Containers provides powerful workload isolation compared to existing container solutions.
  >
  > We will be integrating Kata Containers into OpenShift to provide the ability to run kernel isolated containers for any workload which requires:
  > - custom kernel tuning (sysctl, scheduler changes, cache tuning, etc);
  > - custom kernel modules (out of tree, special arguments, etc);
  > - exclusive access to hardware;
  > - root privileges;
  > - any other administrative privileges above and beyond what is secure in a shared kernel environment (regular runc).
  >
  > It should be noted that Kata Containers differ from Kubevirt:
  >
  > - Kubevirt aims to run **VM images** on OpenShift providing the VM with the look and feel of a virtual machine running as a legacy VM (CRD defining a Virtual Machine in Kubernetes)
  > - Kata Containers aim to run **container images** on OpenShift in an isolated manner using virtualization tools (uses Runtime Class resource to choose Kata only for specific workloads which require kernel level isolation)
