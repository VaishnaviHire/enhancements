# This Week in Enhancements - 2021-03-12

## Enhancements for Release Priorities

### Prioritized Active Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Prioritized Active pull requests:

- [628](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/628): (7/129) general: automated resource request scaling (dhellmann)

  > This enhancement describes an approach to allow us to scale the
  > resource requests for the control plane services to reduce consumption
  > for constrained environments. This will be especially useful for
  > single-node production deployments, where the user wants to reserve
  > most of the CPU resources for their own workloads and needs to
  > configure OpenShift to run on a fixed number of CPUs within the host.
  >
  > One example of this use case is seen in telecommunication service
  > providers implementation of a Radio Access Network (RAN). This use case
  > is discussed in more detail below.

- [593](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/593): (1/131) general: Add proposal for hiding container mountpoints from systemd (lack)

  > The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level
  > namespace for all container and Kubelet mountpoints. However, moving these
  > container-specific mountpoints into a private namespace reduced systemd
  > overhead with no difference in functionality.


## Other Enhancements

### Other Merged Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 2 Other Merged pull requests:

- [684](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/684): (9/9) kube-apiserver: kube-apiserver/audit-policy: document oauth token logging in 4.6+ (sttts)

  > This enhancement describes a high-level API in the `config.openshift.io/v1` API group to configure the audit policy for the
  > API servers in the system. The audit configuration will be part of the [`APIServers`](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/master/config/v1/0000_10_config-operator_01_apiserver.crd.yaml) resource.
  > It applies to all API servers at once.
  >
  > The API is meant to enable customers with stronger audit requirements than the average customer to increase the depth
  > (from _metadata_-only level, over _request payloads_ to _request and response payload_ level) of audit
  > logs, accepting the increased resource consumption of the API servers.
  >
  > This API is intentionally **not about filtering events**. Filtering is to be done via an external mechanism (post-filtering).
  > It was proven through performance tests (compare alternatives section) that this trade-off is acceptable with small two-digit percent overhead.
  >
  > The API is not meant to replace the [upstream dynamic audit](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/f1a799d5f4658ed29797c1fb9ceb7a4d0f538e93/keps/sig-auth/0014-dynamic-audit-configuration.md) API
  > now and in the future. I.e. the API of this enhancement is only about the master node audit files on disk, not about webhooks or
  > any other alternative audit log sink.

#### Minor Other Merged Updates

- [681](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/681): (5/5) kube-apiserver: add oauth token deletion to enhancement (EmilyM1)

### Other New Enhancements

*&lt;PR ID&gt;: (activity this week / total activity) summary*

There were 10 Other New pull requests:

- [679](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/679): (54/54) general: coreos-bootimage-streams: Standardized CoreOS bootimage metadata (cgwalters)

  > Since the initial release of OpenShift 4, we have "pinned" RHCOS bootimage metadata inside [openshift/installer](https://github.com/openshift/installer).
  > In combination with the binding between the installer and release image, this means that everything needed to install OpenShift (including the operating system "bootimages" such as e.g. AMIs and OpenStack `.qcow2` files) are all captured behind the release image which we can test and ship as an atomic unit.
  >
  > We have a mechanism to do [in place updates](https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/master/docs/OSUpgrades.md), but there is no automated mechanism to update "bootimages" past a cluster installation.
  >
  > This enhancement does not describe an automated mechanism to do this: the initial goal is to include this metadata in a standardized format in the cluster and at mirror.openshift.com so that UPI installations can do this manually, and we can start work on an IPI mechanism.

- [680](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/680): (41/41) ingress: Ability to Customize HAProxy 2.x Error Page (miheer)

  > There is no supported and reasonable method to customize the HAProxy 2.x error page as deployed in OpenShift.
  > Customizing the HAProxy error page per our recommended procedure (documented here: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3425711).
  > does not work with OCP 4. It's also important that the right page as per user requirements is served at the right moment.
  > Example - 503 error page shall be returned if no pod is available.
  > But when the URI is wrong/does not exist, we should return 404 or a customized 404 page as per user requirements.

- [682](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/682): (20/20) alerting: alerting as a feature (dofinn)

  > Alerting as a feature is a holistic composition of [alerting standards](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/637) coupled with built-in alerting methodologies (none, symptom based and caused based) with an option to deliver SLOs for a single and/or fleet of clusters.

- [683](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/683): (3/3) insights: WIP Insights Operator pulling and exposing data from the OCM API (tremes)

  > This enhancement will enable the Insights Operator to pull the data (SCA certs)
  > from the OCM (OpenShift Cluster Manager) API. The data will be exposed by the Insights Operator
  > in the OpenShift API to allow users to use them when consuming and building container images
  > on the platform.

- [686](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/686): (15/15) ingress: NE-310 Global options to enable HSTS (candita)

  > In 3.x and 4.x customers can [provide a per-route annotation to enable HSTS](
  > https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/routes/route-configuration.html#nw-enabling-hsts_route-configuration).  For
  > customers with many routes or regulatory compliance issues, the manual per-route annotation is
  > problematic.
  >
  > This enhancement extends the Route API to allow cluster administrators to
  > enable HSTS globally, without having to add an annotation to each route.

- [687](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/687): (1/1) storage: Add AWS EFS CSI driver operator (jsafrane)

  > AWS EFS CSI driver (+ corresponding operator) is an optional OCP component. It should be installed through OLM, when
  > users opts-in.
  >
  > This document describes existing (unsupported) solution and how to turn it into a supported one, both from code (and
  > build and shipment), and from user perspective.

- [688](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/688): (14/14) monitoring: enhancements/monitoring: Describe single replica topology mode (simonpasquier)

  > The Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) needs to respect the
  > `infrastructureTopology` field newly added to the
  > `infrastructures.config.openshift.io` CRD. Depending on the value, it should
  > configure the monitoring operands for highly-available operations or not.

- [689](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/689): (12/12) installer: Add Enhancement for Installing to Azure Stack Hub (patrickdillon)

  > This enhancement covers adding support to install OpenShift clusters to Azure Stack Hub (ASH).
  > Azure Stack Hub looks and feels like standard Azure, but differs significantly in terms of
  > implemenetation and technical details. Azure Stack Hub shares characteristics from [Azure cloud
  > environments](azure-support-known-cloud-environments.md) and on-prem platforms. This enhancement
  > covers details for the Installer to create infrastructure and run an OpenShift cluster on ASH.

- [690](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/690): (3/3) api-review: Add mirror-by-digest-only to ImageContentSourcePolicy (QiWang19)

  > Today, the ImageContentSourcePolicy object sets up mirror configuration with `mirror-by-digest-only` property set to true. This enhancement plans to make `mirror-by-digest-only` a configurable option.

- [691](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/691): (1/1) installer: OpenStack root volume AZs (Fedosin)

  > Numerous customers have requested the ability to run the OpenShift on OpenStack IPI installer with root volumes created in specific availability zones (AZs). This document describes how to achieve that during OpenShift initial installation, and as a day2 operation.
